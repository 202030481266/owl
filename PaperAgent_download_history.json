Based on our\\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even\\nmoderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on\\nat least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal\\nsolution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored\\nfor sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold\\ntrue beyond our range of experiments.
