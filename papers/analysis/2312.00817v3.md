# Main Goal and Fundamental Concept  
**Primary Objective**: To develop a transformer-based pre-trained model (PTM) that enables accurate, long-term forecasting of healthcare time-series data, addressing both **continuously monitored biosignals** (e.g., EEG, body temperature) and **irregularly-sampled clinical records** (e.g., longitudinal patient diagnoses).  

**Core Idea**: Existing transformers struggle with scaling to large time-series data and capturing long-term temporal dependencies. TimelyGPT leverages three innovations—extrapolatable position embeddings, recurrent attention, and temporal convolution—to encode trend/periodic patterns, model global-local dependencies, and enable efficient long-sequence processing.

# Technical Approach  
TimelyGPT’s methodology integrates three key components:  

1. **Extrapolatable Position (xPos) Embedding**: Combines rotation matrices (to capture periodic patterns, e.g., ECG rhythms) and exponential decay (to model trends, e.g., temperature changes). This design enables extrapolation beyond training sequence lengths by encoding relative positional information (distance between timesteps) into token embeddings.  

2. **Recurrent Attention (Retention)**: Adapts the Retention mechanism (originally for language models) to time-series data. It uses chunk-wise processing (segmenting sequences into non-overlapping chunks) to maintain linear training complexity ($O(N)$) and constant inference complexity ($O(1)$). For irregularly-sampled data, the decay mechanism incorporates time gaps between observations (e.g., $t_n - t_m$) to model temporal evolution.  

3. **Convolution Modules**:  
   - **Convolution-Subsampling Tokenizer**: Uses 1D convolutions to extract local features from raw time-series, reducing sequence length by 75% (via stride-2 kernels).  
   - **Temporal Convolution**: Applies depth-wise separable convolutions to sift local interactions in representations, enhancing multi-scale feature learning.  

The model is pre-trained via a **next-token prediction task** (MSE loss for continuous signals, cross-entropy for discrete diagnoses) and fine-tuned end-to-end for downstream forecasting.

# Distinctive Features  
- **Extrapolation Capability**: xPos embedding enables forecasting beyond training lengths (e.g., 6,000 timesteps with a 2,000-timestep prompt), addressing a key limitation of prior transformers.  
- **Dual Data Adaptability**: Handles both continuous biosignals (e.g., Sleep-EDF) and irregularly-sampled EHRs (e.g., PopHR) via time-specific inference (direct prediction at target timesteps) and trajectory-based inference (autoregressive prediction).  
- **Efficiency**: Linear training complexity and constant inference complexity (via chunk-wise Retention) make it scalable to large datasets (e.g., 1.2B timesteps in Sleep-EDF).

# Experimental Setup and Results  
**Datasets**:  
- **Sleep-EDF**: 1.2B timesteps of continuous biosignals (EEG, EOG, body temperature) from 197 sleep recordings.  
- **PopHR**: 489,000 patients’ longitudinal EHRs with 315 PheCodes (diagnosis phenotypes).  

**Key Results**:  
- **Continuous Biosignals**: TimelyGPT outperformed baselines (e.g., PatchTST, DLinear) in MAE and cross-correlation for 6,000-timestep forecasting (e.g., rectal temperature trends aligned with ground truth).  
- **Irregular EHRs**: Time-specific inference achieved top-5 recall of 58.65% and top-10 recall of 70.83% for diagnosing future PheCodes, outperforming models like mTAND and SeFT.  
- **Ablation Studies**: xPos (critical for extrapolation), Retention (enhancing long-range dependencies), and convolution (local feature capture) were validated as key contributors.

# Advantages and Limitations  
**Advantages**:  
- Superior long-term extrapolation over existing transformers (e.g., PatchTST, GPT-2).  
- Efficient scaling to large datasets (aligned with transformer scaling laws).  
- Versatility across continuous and irregular time-series in healthcare.  

**Limitations**:  
- Causal (unidirectional) attention may limit representation expressiveness compared to bidirectional models.  
- Requires large datasets to leverage scaling laws, potentially restricting applicability to smaller healthcare data.

# Conclusion  
TimelyGPT advances healthcare time-series forecasting by integrating extrapolatable position embeddings, recurrent attention, and convolution modules. It excels in long-term extrapolation for both continuous biosignals and irregular EHRs, demonstrating promise for applications like patient health trajectory prediction and risk forecasting. Future work may explore bidirectional architectures and out-of-distribution generalization to enhance transfer learning.
