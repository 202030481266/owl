# Main Goal and Fundamental Concept  
The primary objective of this research is to develop an interpretable, low-dimensional representation of the plasma state in tokamaks to characterize disruptions—sudden losses of plasma confinement that pose significant risks to device components. The core hypothesis is that a latent variable model, extended to handle sequential plasma data and disruption-related patterns, can automatically identify operational regimes and quantify disruption risk, enhancing understanding of disruptive dynamics beyond black-box prediction models.

# Technical Approach  
The method builds on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework with three key extensions:  
1. **Sequential Projections**: A dynamic encoder models plasma trajectories by updating the latent state using time windows of input signals (e.g., magnetic probes, equilibrium parameters) and the previous latent state. This enables tracking of plasma evolution over time.  
2. **Multimodal Structure**: A Gaussian mixture prior (with 8 modes) encourages the latent space to cluster distinct operating regimes (e.g., L-mode, H-mode).  
3. **Disruption Risk Integration**: A neural network maps the latent space to a disruption risk variable \( D_{\text{risk}} \in [0,1] \), trained to reflect the fraction of discharges that disrupt from a given latent state.  

The model is trained using a combined loss function, balancing reconstruction error, KL divergence to the prior, uniform coverage of prior modes, and binary cross-entropy for \( D_{\text{risk}} \). Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) process temporal signals, and positional encoding enhances the decoder’s ability to capture high-frequency patterns.

# Distinctive Features  
- **Multimodal Latent Space**: Unlike standard VAEs, the Gaussian mixture prior explicitly clusters operational regimes (e.g., ITER Baseline Scenario, density limits), enabling separation of disruption types.  
- **Time-Aware Dynamics**: The dynamic encoder models sequential plasma behavior, capturing trajectory-based patterns rather than static snapshots.  
- **Interpretability**: A 2D latent space (for visualization) and component planes (projecting physics quantities back to data space) link latent states to measurable plasma properties (e.g., \( q_{95} \), Greenwald fraction).  
- **Disruption Risk Calibration**: \( D_{\text{risk}} \) is post-calibrated to align with empirical disruption rates, providing a continuous metric of proximity to disruptions.  

---

# Experimental Setup and Results  
**Dataset**: ~1600 TCV discharges (flat-top phase only), including 1147 disruptions and 482 regular terminations. Input signals include equilibrium parameters (e.g., plasma current \( I_p \)) and MHD markers.  
**Evaluation**:  
1. **Disruption Risk**: \( D_{\text{risk}} \) correlates strongly with empirical disruption rates (expected calibration error ~3% on training data, ~7% on test data) and aligns with disruptivity (disruptions per second).  
2. **Regime Separation**: The latent space clusters distinct disruption types (e.g., ITER Baseline, density limit, negative triangularity) and separates confinement states (L-mode vs. H-mode) without explicit labels.  
3. **Downstream Analysis**: Counterfactual analysis identifies disruption-related parameters (e.g., MHD activity for ITER Baseline, Greenwald fraction for density limits) by comparing similar (non-)disrupting discharges.

# Advantages and Limitations  
**Advantages**:  
- Provides an interpretable, low-dimensional map of the plasma operational space, bridging data-driven models and physical intuition.  
- Quantifies disruption risk and distinguishes disruption types, aiding root-cause analysis.  
- Enables downstream tasks (e.g., counterfactual analysis) to identify critical parameters.  

**Limitations**:  
- Focuses on slower timescales (flat-top phase), missing fast disruption precursors.  
- Manual hyperparameter tuning may suboptimize performance.  
- 2D latent space limits expressivity; higher dimensions could capture more complexity.

# Conclusion  
This work introduces a multimodal VAE to model plasma states and disruptions, offering an interpretable latent space that clusters operational regimes, quantifies disruption risk, and supports downstream analysis. While limited by timescale focus and dimensionality, the method enhances understanding of disruptive dynamics and complements existing prediction models, with potential for real-time control applications.
