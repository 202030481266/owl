# Main Goal and Fundamental Concept  
The primary objective of this research is to develop a resource-efficient machine learning algorithm, EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high-level and low-level human activities using a single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on smartglasses. The core idea is to leverage a hierarchical architecture that learns generalizable low-level motion embeddings using semi-supervised training (primarily with high-level activity labels) and uses these embeddings to classify both short-term (1-second) low-level activities (e.g., walking, stationary) and long-term (30-second) high-level activities (e.g., cooking, basketball).  

# Technical Approach  
EgoCHARM employs a two-stage hierarchical design:  
1. **Low-Level Encoder**: A CNN-GRU architecture processes 1-second windows of raw IMU data (3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope) to extract motion embeddings. This encoder uses 1D convolutions with variable dilation to capture periodic motion patterns and a GRU to model temporal sequences. It is lightweight (22k parameters) to enable on-chip deployment on IMUs.  
2. **High-Level Architecture**: A GRU processes aggregated low-level embeddings over 30-second windows to classify high-level activities. The low-level encoder and high-level architecture are trained concurrently using only high-level labels and weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance.  
For low-level activity recognition, the pre-trained low-level encoder is frozen, and a simple probing layer (with 99 parameters) is added to map embeddings to 3 low-level classes (stationary, walking, running).  

# Distinctive Features  
- **Resource Efficiency**: EgoCHARM uses minimal parameters (22k low-level, 63k high-level) and FLOPs, making it deployable on IMU chips with on-chip compute.  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Trains primarily on high-level labels, reducing the need for costly low-level activity annotations.  
- **Generalizable Embeddings**: Low-level embeddings learned from high-level tasks generalize well to low-level activity recognition via a simple probing layer.  
- **Egocentric Focus**: Targets head-mounted IMUs (under-explored compared to body/wrist IMUs), leveraging their low power and privacy advantages for always-on smartglasses.  

# Experimental Setup and Results  
**Data**: Two egocentric IMU datasets (Ego-Exo4D, Nymeria) with 9 high-level (e.g., basketball, cooking) and 3 low-level (stationary, walking, running) activities. Data was split into train/test sets with participant stratification.  
**Results**:  
- High-level recognition: 0.826 F1 score (82.86% accuracy) on 9 classes.  
- Low-level recognition: 0.855 F1 score (90.64% accuracy) on 3 classes via probing.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Performance remains strong with limited samples (500 high-level, 3000 low-level per class), lower sampling frequencies (15Hz vs. 50Hz), and shorter high-level windows (20s vs. 30s).  

# Advantages and Limitations  
**Advantages**:  
- **Efficiency**: Small model size and low compute enable on-chip deployment, saving main processor resources.  
- **Scalability**: Semi-supervised training reduces annotation effort; embeddings can support downstream tasks (e.g., AI assistants).  
- **Generalization**: Low-level embeddings from high-level training work well for low-level tasks.  

**Limitations**:  
- **Low-Motion Activities**: Struggles with low-motion/object manipulation tasks (e.g., cooking, bike repair) due to limited head motion signals.  
- **Device-Specific**: Trained on a single device (Aria V1 glasses); generalization to other devices/IMU locations needs further validation.  

# Conclusion  
EgoCHARM introduces a resource-efficient hierarchical architecture for egocentric IMU activity recognition, achieving strong performance on both high and low-level tasks with minimal parameters. Its semi-supervised design and generalizable embeddings reduce annotation costs and enable on-chip deployment, making it suitable for always-on smartglasses applications. While limited by head IMU constraints in low-motion scenarios, EgoCHARM highlights opportunities for integrating egocentric IMUs into context-aware AI systems.
