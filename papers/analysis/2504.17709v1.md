**Title**: FAULT DIAGNOSIS IN NEW WIND TURBINES USING KNOWLEDGE FROM EXISTING TURBINES BY GENERATIVE DOMAIN ADAPTATION  
**Authors**: Stefan Jonas, Angela Meyer  

# Main Goal and Fundamental Concept  
The primary objective of this research is to address the challenge of unreliable fault diagnosis in wind turbines (WTs) with scarce training data. Normal behavior models (NBMs), which detect anomalies by modeling fault-free operation, require large, representative datasets. However, newly installed or maintained WTs often lack such data, leading to unreliable NBMs. The core idea is to use generative domain adaptation to transform supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data from a target WT (with limited data) to resemble data from a source WT (with abundant data), enabling the use of the source WT’s NBM for accurate fault diagnosis in the target WT.  

# Technical Approach  
The method employs a CycleGAN-based domain mapping framework to translate SCADA data between source and target WTs. Key components include:  
- **Generators and Discriminators**: Two generators ($G_{ST}, G_{TS}$) map SCADA samples between domains, while two discriminators ($Disc_T, Disc_S$) assess realism.  
- **Content-Preserving Losses**:  
  - **Cycle-Consistency Loss**: Ensures mapping a sample to the target domain and back to the source preserves the original content (L1 loss).  
  - **Zero-Loss**: Encourages idle states (e.g., zero power/rotor speed) to map to idle states in the target domain.  
  - **Rated Power Loss**: Ensures rated power outputs map to the corresponding rated power in the target domain.  
- **Autoencoder-Based NBM**: A pretrained autoencoder on the source WT’s normal data reconstructs mapped target data, with reconstruction error used as an anomaly score.  

# Distinctive Features  
This work is the first to apply CycleGAN-based domain mapping to unsupervised anomaly detection with wind turbine SCADA time series. Unlike prior methods (e.g., unconstrained GANs), it enforces content preservation via physics-informed losses (zero and rated power), ensuring operational states (e.g., idle, rated power, anomalies) are retained during domain translation. It also outperforms conventional fine-tuning under severe data scarcity.  

# Experimental Setup and Results  
**Dataset**: SCADA data from 7 WTs (distinct farms, models, and specifications) with 10-minute averages. Data scarcity scenarios (1–8 weeks of training data) are simulated by truncating target WT training sets.  
**Evaluation**: F1-score compares anomaly scores from adapted models to a "ground truth" NBM trained on full target data.  
**Key Results**:  
- NBMs trained on scarce data (e.g., 2 weeks) achieve mean F1-scores of 51.3%, far below the ground truth (84.3% with 2 months).  
- Domain mapping improves F1-scores by +10.3% (1 month) and +16.8% (2 weeks) over scarce data alone, outperforming fine-tuning (e.g., +4.7% for 1 month).  

# Advantages and Limitations  
**Advantages**:  
- Enables reliable fault diagnosis in WTs with scarce data (e.g., newly installed turbines).  
- Outperforms fine-tuning under severe data scarcity (1–8 weeks).  
- Preserves critical operational states via content-consistent losses.  

**Limitations**:  
- Higher computational complexity than fine-tuning.  
- Performance may degrade with abundant target data due to over-constrained losses.  
- WT-specific variations (e.g., domain shift, data representativeness) affect outcomes.  

# Conclusion  
This study introduces a novel generative domain adaptation approach using CycleGAN to address data scarcity in wind turbine fault diagnosis. By mapping SCADA data between WTs and preserving operational states, it enables the use of source WTs’ NBMs for target WTs with limited data. Results demonstrate superior performance over training on scarce data alone and fine-tuning, particularly under severe scarcity. The method shows promise for improving early fault detection in new wind farms, with potential extensions to other anomaly detection tasks under data scarcity.
