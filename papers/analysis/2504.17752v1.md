## Main Goal and Fundamental Concept  
The primary goal of this research is to enable energy-efficient deep learning (DL) inference on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT nodes, drones) by addressing the high energy costs of traditional digital computing architectures. The core hypothesis is that combining wirelessly broadcast model weights with in-physics computation at radio frequency (RF) can drastically reduce energy consumption, bypassing the "memory wall" and data movement bottlenecks of digital systems.

## Technical Approach  
The proposed architecture, **WISE** (Wireless Smart Edge networks), achieves energy-efficient DL inference through two key innovations:  

1. **Disaggregated Model Access via Wireless Broadcasting**: A central radio wirelessly broadcasts DL model weights (frequency-encoded and I/Q modulated onto an RF carrier) to multiple edge clients, eliminating the need for clients to store large models locally.  

2. **In-Physics Computation at RF**: Each client (equipped with a WISE-R radio) performs analog matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) using a passive RF mixer. Model weights (received via wireless broadcast) and local input data (modulated onto a separate RF carrier) are mixed in the analog domain, leveraging the mixer’s inherent signal multiplication capability. The result of the MVM is extracted via low-pass filtering, I/Q demodulation, and lightweight digital processing (e.g., FFT-based decoding).  

Key components include:  
- **Frequency Encoding**: Model weights and input data are encoded onto orthogonal subcarriers using OFDM-like techniques.  
- **Channel Calibration**: Precoding of model weights (W-precoding) or input data (x-precoding) to mitigate wireless channel distortions.  
- **Energy Efficiency Optimization**: Energy consumption is minimized by offloading MVMs to analog RF processing, with only lightweight ADCs and digital FFTs required for decoding.

## Distinctive Features  
- **Wireless Disaggregation**: Leverages existing wireless infrastructure (e.g., antennas, mixers) to broadcast model weights, enabling shared access across multiple clients without local storage.  
- **Analog RF Computation**: Uses passive RF mixers (ubiquitous in edge devices) to perform MVMs in the analog domain, reducing energy consumption by orders of magnitude compared to digital ASICs.  
- **Scalability**: Energy efficiency improves with larger problem sizes (e.g., MVM dimensions), approaching thermodynamic limits as the input size scales.

## Experimental Setup and Results  
**Setup**: A software-defined radio (SDR) platform (USRP X310) with a central radio broadcasting model weights over a 25 MHz ISM band (0.915 GHz) to three clients. Each client uses a Mini-Circuits ZEM-4300+ mixer for in-physics MVM.  

**Datasets**: MNIST (image classification) and AudioMNIST (audio classification) with a 3-layer fully connected (FC) model.  

**Key Results**:  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Achieved 6.0 fJ/MAC (165.8 TOPS/W) for 95.7% MNIST accuracy and 2.8 fJ/MAC (359.7 TOPS/W) for 97.2% AudioMNIST accuracy—2–3 orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art digital ASICs (1 pJ/MAC).  
- **Scalability**: Energy efficiency improved with larger MVM dimensions (e.g., 1.4 fJ/MAC for 32,768-dimensional inner products).  
- **Accuracy**: Matched digital computing accuracy (e.g., 98.1% MNIST digital vs. 95.7% WISE at 6.0 fJ/MAC).

## Advantages and Limitations  
**Advantages**:  
- **Ultra-Low Energy**: Analog RF computation and wireless model sharing reduce energy by 2–3 orders of magnitude.  
- **Scalability**: Energy efficiency improves with problem size, approaching thermodynamic limits.  
- **Practicality**: Uses existing RF hardware (mixers, antennas), enabling deployment on ubiquitous edge devices.  

**Limitations**:  
- **Wireless Channel Dependence**: Requires channel calibration (precoding) to mitigate signal distortions, adding complexity.  
- **Prototype Constraints**: Current mixer performance (on-off switching) limits high-SNR accuracy; larger bandwidths (e.g., 100 MHz wired) improve throughput but require specialized hardware.

## Conclusion  
WISE introduces a transformative architecture for energy-efficient edge DL by combining wireless disaggregation of model weights with in-physics computation at RF. By leveraging existing RF infrastructure and analog signal processing, WISE achieves orders-of-magnitude energy efficiency gains over digital ASICs, enabling scalable deployment of intelligent edge devices. Future work aims to refine hardware (e.g., integrated analog mixers) and expand to larger models (e.g., transformers).
